# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I am a technical writer in Portland, Oregon. I work for a telecommunications company, primarily creating end-user documentation.
I don't code much. But when I do. I code in C for small Arduino projects. My last project was a 3x3x3 LED cube, which I constructed and programmed. My current project (archived) is a 6x6x6 RGB LED cube, using intelligent LEDs.
